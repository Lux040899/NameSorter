#Name Sorter

Name Sorter is a program in C# to sort a list of given names based on the LastName.


#Prerequisites

Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

#Assumptions

We assume that the input file is well formatted and completely popullated.
Still I have implemented functionality to handle the code in case the input file doesn't meet the requiremenrts. 


#Usage 

Pass in an input text file, with all the unsorted names, as a command line argument and the program creates an ouput text file named sorted-names-list.txt, with all the sorted names.
